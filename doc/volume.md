Sound volume research
=====================

Input sound
-----------
660Hz sine, Peak amplitude 0.8

Outputs
-------
Volume =    0   Peak = 0.8

Volume =  -452  Peak = 0.47482

Volume = -1054  Peak = 0.23694


Yeah, these are millibel. But why are my sounds so silent then?

Aha! The sounds for the measurement were 44.1kHz. The menu sounds are 22.01kHz.
Does the way Drakan resamples these make them louder?
