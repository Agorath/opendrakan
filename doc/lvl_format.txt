Layer data block format
-----------------------

    Zlib-compressed

    First block is vertex data
    4 bytes per vertex. Top left vertex appears first, then filled left to right, top to bottom
    
        first byte is type. type 0 is normal. values 0-75 are defined. working on list later
        
        second byte is always 0x01. no idea what it does yet.
        
        third and fourth byte seems to be height offset divided by two (can't change height in smaller units)
        value is biased, so 0x8000 means an offset of 0, 0x7FFF means -2 and 0x8002 means +4 etc.
        
        
    Second block is face data
    26 bytes per face, top left face first, then filled left to right, top to bottom
    
        first 2 bytes seem to be flags. low bit is face division:
               +-+      +-+
            0= |/|   1= |\|
               +-+      +-+
               
        followed by two 4-byte-words which are database references for the face textures. 
        first is for left triangle, second is right triangle.
        
        followed by that, 16 bytes that indicate texture orientation, but in what way i can not tell yet
